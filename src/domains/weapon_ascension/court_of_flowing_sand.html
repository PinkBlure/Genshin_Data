                    Watatsumi Island is the furthest from Narukami Island in
                    the Inazuman island chain, and its name means "the god of
                    the oceans" in the island's ancient tongue. Legend has it
                    that when the great serpent first arose within the abyssal
                    nation of ever-night, its fluorescent body was covered in
                    myriad-colored coral.

                    This coral cannot be found anywhere in Teyvat, but was a
                    gift that the great serpent obtained when it broke into the
                    Dark Sea. For that abyssal snake, to be filled with coral
                    was to be mighty, and its power would be shaved away as
                    those corals were lost. In other words, those corals
                    contain power far beyond the norm.

                    Fleeing into the Dark Sea, the god that had lost everything
                    met the abandoned people who had nothing within the ocean
                    depths. Thus it elected to remain and become their
                    "Orobashi no Mikoto," their "Watatsumi Omikami."
                    It is said that the great snake god once broke off all the
                    coral branches on its body to give light to the children
                    who were curled up in the darkness. They also say that it
                    used these coral branches to create a huge ladder to allow
                    those children to once again reach the surface and see the
                    light of day.

                    The meaning that lies behind the name "Watatsumi" is simply
                    the unrequited hopes that the abandoned people who dwelt in
                    the deep sea pinned upon the serpent god that led them.
                    And it was also because the serpent god now had people who
                    worshiped it that it stayed in the world it should have
                    long fled, breaking off the coral branches that adorned its
                    body, treading upon land where it should not have, and
                    facing a foe it could never hope to match — till at last,
                    its divine form was sundered along with the mountains, its
                    ichor turned into plasma, and its will and power became a
                    curse that could never be extinguished: Tatarigami.

                    In the past, the ancients would climb the peak now known as
                    Mt. Yougou and bend wood that had been charred by lightning
                    into a hook to offer as an effigy unto the thundering force
                    that lit up the skies and shook the earth. This shape would
                    eventually become the "Electro Mitsudomoe" symbol,
                    symbolizing the favor, wisdom, and might of Electro, and
                    also the people who represent these values.

                    Those who belong to the Shogunate Commissions are those who
                    administer and exercise power. In the monster-filled tales
                    of the ancient past, those who were deeply trusted by the
                    Shogun would bear talismans with this hooked design on
                    their person, and just as the word "commission" means to
                    "joyfully serve" in the old tongue, those who received her
                    favor would return it with love and loyalty. Yet, after a
                    certain point in time, nothing would be as it was before.

                    All demons who wander in the wilderness or live amongst
                    mortals will be attracted by the sight of the Almighty
                    Narukami Ogosho, represented by the Electro Mitsudomoe.
                    Though their lives may be longer than any creature, they
                    will at last come to their end. If those with limited
                    lifespans hanker after eternity, then they can only pray
                    that "Eternity" remembers them. And she did indeed answer
                    their prayers, remembering them all, friend and foe alike,
                    in her heart. No matter whether it was the demon owls who
                    resided amidst the fog and ripped through the skies, the
                    bake-danuki who dared to trespass her imperial gardens, or
                    that female oni, lovely as the moon and mighty in battle,
                    yet who would eventually come to blows with her... Whether
                    it was the tengu who soared on dark wings or the Kitsune
                    Saiguu who once walked by her side, but who eventually
                    disappeared forever...
                    These countless tales have come to rest within her heart,
                    and someday, they will surely shine again in the eternal
                    paradise of her dreams.

                    The treasure of the lord of thunder is her majesty, and
                    that majesty is embodied in her valor and wrath. Her wrath
                    comes from the love that persists in her heart, and her
                    valor supports that anger. Thus, whomsoever should block
                    the path towards eternity or lay a finger on Inazuma's
                    people shall become her foe.
                    They say that there were four great spirits, three divine
                    foxes, and two great swords — but that the symbol of Her
                    Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, could only be a
                    single strike, unsurpassed and brilliant as a meteor.

                    Weapon Ascension Material.
                    Folktales tell that once upon a time, there lived an oni
                    named Torachiyo. Torachiyo was a highly skilled warrior,
                    such that it was once said the Torachiyo might dance amid a
                    thousand blades, juunihitoe robes becoming shredded like
                    falling violet petals, and yet not receive a single wound.
                    Yet this oni would eventually betray the Shogun and revolt,
                    becoming shorn of an arm and a horn in the battle before
                    fleeing and slaying itself in a fit of furious madness.
                    Hearsay holds that the stubborn oni often hold fear and
                    distress in their hearts. That they should fantasize about
                    eternity yet fear the moment, and are apt to become
                    swallowed by terror or anger is their just reward. This
                    mask depicts Torachiyo, fangs bared.

                    "Sumirezome Sangetsu Kogetsukan" depicts the fierce oni
                    Torachiyo shattering the Shogun's naginata with a single
                    bite, thus gaining the upper hand for a time. As such,
                    masks that are based on him have finely crafted fangs.
                    In the denouement of this tale, the wounded oni fled into
                    the forest, deathly afraid of showing himself even to the
                    cold moonlight. The wind that whispers through the alleys
                    and valleys can be said to resemble his quiet cries of
                    agony, and so there is a poetic seasonal expression for
                    this in Inazuma: "Torachiyo's Wind."

                    In the lost songs of the oni nursemaids, Torachiyo was an
                    elegant young man, strong of body and fair of face. He was
                    once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed
                    her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones,
                    winning renown for the oni, whose blood thinned with each
                    passing day.
                    None now sing these songs, but the mask of a horned oni,
                    even in a different form, still possesses power beyond the
                    norm.

                    Weapon Ascension Material.
                    Chiyo, a warrior of the oni tribe with the Electro
                    Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once
                    swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had
                    a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the
                    forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's
                    innards apart from within, breaking free.
                    This is the origin of the phrase "Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,"
                    and would be changed over many years to "Torachiyo."
                    But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a
                    deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those
                    blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye
                    could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the
                    Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would
                    be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest
                    like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken
                    for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps
                    by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura
                    Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had
                    been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or
                    perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll
                    near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her
                    life's journey.
                    Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days
                    were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and
                    then became them were hardly the minority. The border
                    between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind
                    is perhaps not merely monodirectional.
