                    The place now known as Stormterror's Lair was once the
                    capital city of Decarabian, the God of Storms. Since this
                    dream of prosperity was created entirely by his divine
                    might, the broken pieces left behind by the shattering of
                    that dream still possess great power.

                    Decarabian, the God of Storms, was content with the capital
                    city he had raised, and accepted the worship of the people
                    from atop his tower. But he knew not that the people did

                    Andrius' wolf pack is its blessed honor guard, and even the
                    milk teeth of a wolf cub possess great potential.
                    In the past, the gods had the responsibility to love all
                    people. Andrius was therefore quite unusual in that he
                    became leader of the wolves, while only welcoming abandoned
                    babies and wanderers when it came to humans.

                    The life of a wolf is not without violence; broken bones or
                    cracked teeth are nothing special.
                    Andrius found humans to be a disappointment, but believed
                    babies to be innocent. If both the wolf pack and the
                    adopted children chose each other, then they become a
                    Lupical, a fated family.

                    The wolf pack also understands that humans are not solitary
                    creatures. The honorary broken tooth is a parting gift said
                    to bring protection and luck.
                    In the legends of a far-off world, a female wolf once
                    adopted two great humans. Their home was known as the Cave
                    of Wolves, or Lupercal - that word meaning the same thing
                    as Lupical does in this world.
