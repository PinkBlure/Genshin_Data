                    Under the instructions of the First Sage, the ancestors of
                    the forest people made these talismans using withered trees
                    to commemorate the Lord of Verdure.
                    The talisman's shape was inspired by the forest dew. It
                    symbolizes the permeation of wisdom into mortal minds.

                    Later, the Lord of Verdure taught people the mystery of the
                    forging of black iron. The innocent mortals thus grasped
                    the knowledge of using fire to forge blades.
                    The Lord of Verdure took pleasure in their knowledge â€”
                    Lethal as fire and blades were to her, they made ordinary
                    people powerful.

                    In the myriad lore of the forest, the one in the striped
                    cape that resembled blazing flames was the Greater Lord of
                    the Labyrinths and the Owner of the Moon-Mirrored Spring.
                    When he bowed his head and struck up a friendship with the
                    Lord of Verdure, the tokens of their friendship were the
                    gems that glimmered like water and silver that gleamed like
                    the moonlight.
                    To repay such a gesture, the Lord of Verdure promised to
                    keep secrets for the Greater Lord of the Labyrinths and
                    safeguard the intricate and beautiful dreams of the
                    rainforest.
                    No one could have foretold that the magnificent mansion of
                    secrets and dreams would later fade away amidst the shroud
                    of the dark flame of oblivion, after which its ash returned
                    to the soil and became nutrients for the virgin
                    rainforests.

                    "Mortals hold dear three things only: the spring water that
                    embraces the moonlight, verdant life, and ageless youth..."
                    The nature of "wisdom" is not domination over all minds or
                    scheming to gain all the benefit. Instead, it is about
                    empowering even ordinary beings to one day overcome their
                    imposed constraints.
                    Though the roar of the tiger is no longer heard in the
                    forest and the resilient guardians would seclude themselves
                    within the dreams of children... On the night when every
                    secret golden seal is lifted and all dreams glow like amber
                    in the moonlight, perhaps she and her beloved people will
                    eventually win genuine freedom.

                    People used to say that the Lord of Flowers was the Lord of
                    Joy and Happiness. Freshwater sprang from her sleeves, and
                    thus was the oasis of blossoming flowers born in the
                    desert. Flowers and grasses followed in her footsteps, and
                    gleaming moonlight cleared the way for her.
                    In the bitter days when the sky turned its back on the
                    ground, the Lord of Flowers extended her mercy to each and
                    every one of the mortals, letting them regain their
                    happiness and egos, allowing leisure and luxury to resume.

                    In the literature buried deep beneath the yellow sands, the
                    Lord of Flowers was the Mistress of Dreams.
                    She bestowed dreams upon the exiled, the manic, and the
                    foolish. In those dreams, they were presented with their
                    dearest delights. Burdened by the brutality of reality,
                    they were fascinated by the charm of the Lord of Flowers
                    and captivated by her beauty and care.

                    The Lord of Flowers was in an amicable relationship with
                    the Jinn.
                    The Mistress of Flowers and Oases joined hands with the
                    Lord of Deserts and built Ay-Khanoum, the "City of
                    Amphitheaters," which carried the meaning of "City of the
                    Moon Maiden" in the ancient language of the Jinn.
                    Later, however, it was said that the Lord of Flowers died
                    due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand, after
                    which the blossoms of purple Padisarahs were never seen
                    again in the oases.
                    After the departure of the Lord of Flowers, the sandstorms
                    keened, the Jinn sobbed, and the moonlight-silver gem disc
                    lost its original, glad purpose, giving off a mournful
                    glimmer.

                    "Who would worship a departed god?"
                    The Lord of Flowers was once in alliance with two other 
                    gods. Apart from wisdom and power, she also brought mercy 
                    and joy to her people.
                    Just as the earth needs more than the burning sunshine and
                    pouring rain, to the people of the Lord of Flowers, joy and
                    love, singing and music, and wine and extravagance were
                    just as vital as strength and sensibility.
                    It is said that flowers blossom so that they may enjoy a
                    spectacular death, and that death was precisely the
                    wholehearted pursuit of the Lord of Flowers â€” for death
                    adds bitterness to lost joy, and intensifies with time
                    across endless memories.
                    The ignorant Lord of Deserts was never aware of her
                    reasoning. He only reveled in her immense charm and grace â€”
                    and as misguided as such fervent affections might be, they
                    were well within the calculations of the Lord of Flowers.

                    A long time ago, the people of the Lord of Deserts carved
                    these imperial insignias based on robust beetles to
                    memorialize the bright sun that marked the shifting of day
                    and night, as well as the infinity of such times.
                    Though the name of that Lord is no longer mentioned, these
                    imperial insignias have been preserved through time, each
                    bearing a faint ambiance of those past glories.
                    These insignias travel with the descendants of the Eremite
                    Tribe, silently telling the tales of their then-Lord.

                    To weave together myriad thoughts and reign over countless
                    souls â€” this is the essence of power.
                    However, power is not cold-blooded tyranny. Its true ideal,
                    at its heart, is to create a utopia free of worry, schemes,
                    and slavery.
                    It was just as the silent lord saw in the crystal's
                    secrets, and just as the lost companion had once taught.
                    The dark insect insignia and the steel judgment thus laid
                    the foundations of the kingdom's rules.

                    Silver moonlight and clear springs once completed the
                    scenery of the oases. But as the Lord of Flowers faded in
                    the darkening sandstorm, so was the worriless golden
                    paradise submerged by death.
                    In the poetry of the Eremite Tribe, the moon cast its
                    silver light on the crimson mantle, causing Al-Ahmar, the
                    Mourning King, to be driven to madness.
                    In a melancholic desert ballad, driven by the haunting
                    nostalgia, the lonely king created an ever-youthful
                    dreamland in the center of the desert, where undisturbed
                    water sprang up and perpetual dusk remained.

                    scorching sun.
                    Ancient stone tablets record that he turned his power into
                    seven rays of blinding light or seven pillars, which he
                    granted equally and mercifully to everyone. No one was
                    neglected, nor was anyone discontented.
                    That was a forgotten golden era, an era when the Lord of
                    Flowers had faded into the sands and the Lord of Verdure
                    was determined to leave. Only the descendants in the yellow
                    sand chose to follow their god. Even as the grim shadow of
                    calamity loomed, the power in which they had faith shone
                    brightly like amber and gold.
                    Yet calamity befell nonetheless, and the golden insectoid
                    insignias were buried beneath the depths of shrine and
                    palace, under collapsed pillars engraved with images of
                    eagles and bulls.
