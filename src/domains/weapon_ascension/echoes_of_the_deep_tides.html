                    A harp with rotten keys. Its voice blocked, it cannot be
                    played nor its sound heard.
                    It is said the descendants of the forgotten music once
                    lacquered mechanical wooden harps with gold in order to
                    revive the magnificent remnants of the ancient dynasty,
                    futilely attempting to match them to the silent golems...
                    A long time passed, and then more, and the rotten, off-key
                    harps remained in the grasp of those silent giants,
                    caressed by the waves, playing only sorrowful strains.

                    Legends say that the survivors of that ancient dynasty once
                    cast a harp out of black iron to commemorate and mourn.
                    A harp cast of black iron cannot be played. To mourn that
                    ancient dynasty that was once so proud of its golden music,
                    those remaining forged this heavy instrument and its yet
                    weightier silence.
                    But no matter what, the black iron harp remained as silent
                    as that lost era.

                    In that great disaster, the golden palace sank with its
                    throne, the music was shattered, the notes turned to
                    silence...
                    But the remnants of that empire never gave up their desire
                    for salvation and to surpass fate.
                    To save their waning civilization and their desire to
                    transcend, the Golden Troupe played melodies most wondrous,
                    enticing children to offer their precious souls to the
                    sleeping golems.

                    The God King's Grand Symphony is composed of countless
                    melodies linked together, but its main thesis is submerged
                    under the common destiny of the Water Nation.
                    The harmonies of those carefree years and sonatas were once
                    the greatest representation of civilization and order, but
                    when the prosperous empire descended into a playground for
                    tyrants, the brutal despots tore the connection with the
                    source asunder under the cover of golden cloaks, and
                    discord finally swarmed through the empireâ€”
                    The original song of fate continued to ring out on a score
                    of fading gold, unperturbed by all... until all was
                    dissolved, and all returned to chaos.

                    Legends say that before the birth of life, there was a
                    dense primordial sea. It is the purest origin of all
                    things, and one day, it will also swallow all life... and
                    those things which did not arise from it will be filtered
                    out, becoming naught but floating detritus.
                    "The existence of detritus also has meaning â€” What kind of
                    thing would be rejected by the source of all things that
                    swallows all life?" the young Harmost asked the great
                    usurper, pondering this conundrum.

                    "Life that came from the primordial sea is inevitably fated
                    to return to it." Thus spoke the Harmost Boethius. "But
                    there are infinite possibilities for humans to transcend,
                    and even the waters of the primordial sea cannot completely
                    dissolve them..."
                    The arrogant usurper once attempted to mix insoluble Ichor
                    with pure water, to contain wisdom and memories, allowing
                    his subjects and servants to discard their physical bodies,
                    and obtain independent, eternal lives.
                    But the pain of severing soul and body cannot be endured by
                    any ordinary life, and the usurper's order tore apart and
                    shattered souls...
                    The Ichor was dyed black by the crying and howling of so
                    many souls, and it lost its harmony and wisdom, leaving
                    only chaos and madness.

                    This is a relic from a time when the Lochknights still
                    roamed â€” the knights said, there were still loyal spirits
                    in the mountain springs and valleys where none tread,
                    guarding those pure, unpolluted springs...
                    However, the creator of artificial Ichor couldn't tolerate
                    any discord in his great symphony. It is said that wherever
                    the Harmost Boethius went, the natural nectar was buried,
                    the aqueducts of the empire were built, and the spirits
                    born of pure water vanished without a trace...

                    A dense and pure solution, derived and refined from drops
                    of the vast primordial sea. The ancient God King once
                    believed it would bring eternal life and infinite wisdom,
                    but listening carefullyâ€” it was quietly, faintly
                    prophesizing the final end of all dissolving into one.
T                   his was once the God King's unfinished Grand Symphony â€” a
                    boundless, sourceless golden Ichor replacing the wild
                    primeval waters, and the glorious immortal sages bringing
                    nectar-like enlightenment to the ignorant corners of the
                    world.
                    But the God King's delusions ultimately sank into the
                    depths of the black abyss, and with the ravages of time,
                    the golden Ichor was eventually corroded by the primordial
                    soup...
                    The tuner turned a blind eye to the evil omens, and
                    supporting his broken body, continued to give life to his
                    compatriots according to the plans once laid, so that the
                    old order might one day return...
                    Even today, many mad poets and painters of Fontaine see the
                    apocalypse experienced by Boethius, a reminder of the
                    inescapable cycle of the world.

                    Legend says that when the first usurper came to the
                    primordial sea, the first sovereign gave him a goblet of
                    water.
                    Later, he became the unquestioned god-king, and used this
                    goblet of water to refine the mysterious drops of dew,
                    establishing a splendid and powerful empire.
                    But that is now an ancient story, whose main characters now
                    sleep in the phosphorescence of the schools of the
                    deepwater fish.

                    What kind of empire can last for a thousand years? After
                    returning from the kingdom of dragons, the usurper once
                    pondered this question.
                    Combining the immortal stone with the Ichor essence
                    extracted from primordial water, and carved into a race as
                    black as iron â€” with arcane lithos for skin and Ichor for
                    blood, never again fearing the curse of returning to the
                    primeval past...
                    The silent golem still dreams the dream of the empire â€” not
                    knowing it has been over a thousand years since the
                    empire's obliteration.

                    In the years when the golden shroud covered the land, pure
                    spring water had to be hidden away in concealed mountain
                    streams, and the Lochknights were born in these
                    sanctuaries.
                    The knights swear by armor of silver, to protect the
                    spirits born from pure water, to protect their fellows who
                    also keep faith in the one true font, resisting the
                    omnipresent golden power that blotted out the sky and
                    outshone the sun.
                    But that is an ancient legend... Not long after the empire
                    collapsed and sank, the knights who resisted the usurper
                    shed their armor, and their stories were hidden in a
                    tangled web of stories and ballads.

                    When the Usurper of the sunken city played the last
                    movement of the golden symphony, the favored musician stole
                    the golden goblet brimming with Ichor.
                    Shocked by the foolhardy betrayal of the God King, the
                    musician summoned the last guards, and used the insoluble
                    Ichor to seal the dragon beneath the tall tower, and sank
                    into the abyss with the capital.
                    Afterwards, this noble thief vanished silently from
                    history, and only the "Golden Troupe" faithfully remembers
                    his prophecy.
